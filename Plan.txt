OTHELLO PLAN

Plan:
1. Show how to play the game if the person playing does not know how(Show examples of a potential move)
2. print the default board which is 8 by 8 using two for loops each going to 8
3. Print that it is player 1s turn then ask them where they want to place their piece.
4. How to input the coordinates will be explained at the beginning
5. there will be a method that checks wether the coordinates were typed in correctly otherwise it will ask again (error check)
6. There will have to many checks to determine what the board will look like after the piece that was placed takes effect.
The checks include:
-if the piece is beside at least one other of the opponents pieces
-if so it will check if there are more pieces in that linear direction or if there is a piece that belongs to the player 1
if that is true then all the pieces of the opponent that are linearly between that of player 1 will be turned into player 1s
-This check will happen by adding or subtracting 1 of the 2d array and checking those positions
-there will have to be an exception for any pieces in the corrners or on the sides(probably get seperate methods or if statements)

-Then player 2 will have a turn and so on
-once the limit of pieces is up, whoever has the most pieces wins

Goal:
get all the functionality of the game working so that all the moves work properly
have at least some error checking for common errors (all of the error checking is a lot of work)
